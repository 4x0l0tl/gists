= The Diaspora graph model

Sarah Mei recently wrote a http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2013/11/11/why-you-should-never-use-mongodb/[blog post] describing how she and her colleagues modelled a TV show and a social network, and as I read more of the post it felt like both domains were very graphy in nature.

We wanted to see if our intuition was right and so with the help of Cypher, created a mini version of each of the domains that Sarah described.

The TV show model is as follows:
